- Bravo Team Mission Framework --
By Folau

Overview:
This is a lightweight mission framework for Bravo Team missions.

Instructions:
The only files that will need editing should be:

1. The briefing sections - LEAVE THE MAIN ALONE. Breaking those includes = RIP server

2. Description.ext for mission name and any parameter defaults

3. Endings in endings.hpp (call in trigger with    "End1" call BIS_fnc_endMissionServer;   )
